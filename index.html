        <p>Hey Manvi,</p>
        <p>Wish you a very, very Happy Birthday </p>
        <p>I hope you have a fantastic day and a wonderful year ahead. I have always wished the best for you and I genuinely hope you fulfil all your aspirations</p>
        <p>I might not say it enough, but you are a very special friend of mine and indeed a wonderful person to know. Making unrealistic plans to 
          doing the most childish things together, we have come a long way. And I am counting on you for discussing my retirement plans as well:)
      
        </p>
        <p>My only piece of advice: Hakuna Matata</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is important to let life unfold whatever it has in store for us</p>
        <p>Lastly, just know, I'll always be there for you</p>
        <p>Always.</p>
